					Project Proposal</h3>
				<p>
					My proposal for my Cloud Server Project is to deploy a virtual machine that will host a website. 
					The purpose of my website will be to recommend movies to users based on their ratings of movies
					they have watched and a place for critiquing said movies, my placeholder website name is "Next Watch". 
					How Next Watch will recommend movies is by making use of three main pieces of information.</p>
				<p>
					Firstly, the user’s ratings, Next Watch will have a page where the user can rate movies they
					have watched. These ratings will be stored and tied to the user’s account. At present it is 
					undecided what the user ratings will look like. It is most likely that the ratings will be either a
					number 1-10 or like/dislike.</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, the movie database, only movies contained in the database can be rated by and 
					recommended to the user. Every movie in the database will have a unique sequence of assigned values
					that will determine how it compares to other movies. This will include multiple scales 1-10 based on
					various characteristics of the movie such as how much a given genre can be applied to the movie.</p>
				<p>
					Thirdly, the formula, to recommend movies to users a formula will be developed. This formula 
					will take the user’s ratings and compare the assigned values of rated movies to the database of 
					movies. The intent is that the formula returns the database of movies ordered by the user’s 
					likeliness to enjoy the movies.</p>
				<p>
					I will need; a Virtual Machine running in the cloud, a static IPv4 address, a DNS service, a 
					digital certificate and a lot of time to work on this project.</p>

					Licence Rationale</h3>
				<p>
					I have chosen to license Next Watch under copyright, as there are original creative works that
					I want to protect. I do not want Next Watch's algorithm or likeness to be used commercially or
					redistributed without my explicit permission. Each poster being displayed on Next Watch will have
					their own individual licences. Posters will be displayed in accordance with fair use since Next 
					Watch will contain movie critiques and is not commercial or monetized at present. My licence marking
					will include my copyright notice and a statement regarding images on the site.</p>
